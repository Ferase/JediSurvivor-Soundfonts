# STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor Soundfont Pack V2.0

This is a pack of smoothswing soundfonts I made based on characters from Jedi: Survivor. This pack comes in Proffie and Xenopixel formats.

-------------------------------------

## Included Fonts

- Cal Kestis
  - Comes with all 10 colors present in the game
    - Normal and crossguard variants for each
- Purge Trooper Electrostaff
- Ninth Sister
- Second Sister
- Dagan Gera
  - Light and dark versions
- Rick's Stun Baton
- Cere Junda
- Darth Vader
- Bode Akuna

## Blade Styles

Updated ProffieOS Blade Styles are included in the `/Blade Styles/` directory of their repective soundfonts. They're based on Fett263's Survivor styles and were hand tweaked by [crazy.hair](https://github.com/crazy-hair). More information and instructions on how to set them up can be found in the readme.md file in the `/Blade Styles/` directory. Only the Multi-Phase/Alt Font styles are included, as the other blade styles are trivial to download from the Fett263 [Style Library configurator](https://www.fett263.com/fett263-proffieOS7-style-library.html).

The previous soundfonts can be found here:

On the [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightsabers/comments/1709h78/jedi_survivor_soundfont_pack_v2_proffie_xenopixel/), u/Sword-Logic graciously shared some blade styles they made for these soundfonts in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/lightsabers/comments/1709h78/comment/kcyli9r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)! Thank you so much for allowing me to link these!!

Here's a copy-paste of their comment where they go over the styles and some instructions on what you need in order to use them:

- These Multi-Phase Bladestyles require **ProffieOS 7.12 or later, Fett263's Prop File, and Alt Font setup.**

- If you are not running this version of OS7 or later, please update before using these style codes.

- If you do not have Fett263's Prop File enabled, go to Fett263.com and read over how to change the Prop File you are using.

- If you don't know how to set up Alt Fonts, please go to [the ProffieOS Documentation page](https://pod.hubbe.net/sound/alt_sounds.html) and familiarize yourself.

- Please read over the Style Codes to understand how the Special Abilities controls to change Phases within the bladestyles (among other functions) work.

- [Bode Akuna](https://pastebin.com/HWJ4seem) (Blaster Stance to Heavy Stance)

- [Cal Kestis, Jedi: Survivor Style](https://pastebin.com/UwH86FBx) (Blue to Cyan to Green to Indigo to Magenta to Orange to Purple to Yellow to White to Red)

- [Cal Kestis, Jedi: Fallen Order Style](https://pastebin.com/T1qprZi8) (Blue to Cyan to Green to Indigo to Magenta to Orange to Purple to Yellow to White to Red) **Note: This one does not feature changes to the blade animations like the Jedi: Survivor version does, as Cal's blade does not change animations based on color in Jedi: Fallen Order.**

- [Dagan Gera](https://pastebin.com/1K5r607w) (Light to Dark)

## Feedback

If you use any of these soundfonts, I would really appreciate your feedback! These are far from perfect and I'm sure I will come across things myself that I want to improve, but if you have any suggestions, problems, or feedback of any kind, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Ferase/JediSurvivor-Soundfonts/issues) and let me know!
