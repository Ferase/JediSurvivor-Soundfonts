# STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor Soundfont Pack V2.0

This is a pack of smoothswing soundfonts I made based on characters from Jedi: Survivor. This pack comes in Proffie and Xenopixel formats.

-------------------------------------

## Included Fonts

- Cal Kestis
    - Comes with all 10 colors present in the game
        - Normal and crossguard variants for each
- Purge Trooper Electrostaff
- Ninth Sister
- Second Sister
- Dagan Gera
    - Light and dark versions
- Cere Junda
- Darth Vader
- Bode Akuna

Currently, I have not made blade styles to go with these fonts yet. I don't have a way to push blade styles to my Proffie, so I can't test anything I would make. I would recommend looking around on [Fett26's website](https://www.fett263.com) and use one of his free presets until I can get around to making custom styles.

## Feedback

If you use any of these soundfonts, I would really appreciate your feedback! These are far from perfect and I'm sure I will come across things myself that I want to improve, but if you have any suggestions, problems, or feedback of any kind, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Ferase/JediSurvivor-Soundfonts/issues) and let me know!
