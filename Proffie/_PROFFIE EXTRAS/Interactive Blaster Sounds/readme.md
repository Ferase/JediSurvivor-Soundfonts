# Interactive Blaster Sounds

These sounds are intended to be used with Fett236's [Interactive Blasters](https://crucible.hubbe.net/t/proffieos7-proof-of-concept-interactive-blaster-deflection/2128) which adds `blast` alongside `blst`, with `blst` functioning as the sound of the lightsaber deflecting the blaster bolt and `blast` being the blaster bolt itself.

If you would like to use all possible blaster sounds, grab the `blast` and `blst` folders in **All Blaster Sounds** and put them in your font of choice. Alternatively, you can put together your own selection of blaster sounds in the **Make-Your-Own Blaster Sets** folder.

**NOTE:** If you make your own blaster set, don't forget to grab the `blst` folder from **All Blaster Sounds**.
