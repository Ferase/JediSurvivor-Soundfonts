# Make-Your-Own Blaster Sets

In each folder are sets of blaster sounds from various sources in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. You can take any combination of these sounds and put them together to create your own personalized `blast` soundset for interactive blaster sounds.

To create a custom blaster soundset, take all of the WAV files you want, put them into a folder named `blast`, and sequentially name them `blast###.wav`. After this, just put it in your soundfont and replace the `blst` folder with the one from the **All Blaster Sounds** folder just above this one.
