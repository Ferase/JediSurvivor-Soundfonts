These blade styles take advantage of Fett263's Multi-Phase blade to combine both the Light and Dark soundfonts and colors into one preset. They require the [Alt Font](https://pod.hubbe.net/sound/alt_sounds.html) setup and [Fett263's prop file](https://www.fett263.com/proffieOS7-fett263-prop-file.html) to be active on your Proffie saber with the `FETT263_SPECIAL_ABILITIES` define in your config.
If you don't know what that means, you probably don't have it enabled on your saber.

You can find a pre-configured Alt Font soundfont directory in the main Dagan Gera folder. You use it as you would any other soundfont.

Included are 3 different styles. They're all the same except for the different Interactive Blast configurations. 

To cycle between Light and Dark, you just need to hold down the power button (or alt button, if you have one) on your saber and twist left or right. Doing so while the blade is on will instantly change the font/color, while doing it while the blade is off will change to the next color while igniting the blade.

`dagan_gera_no_interactive_blast` is the standard blade style and doesn't require any additional sound files or configuration.

`dagan_gera_single_interactive_blast` and `dagan_gera_continuing_interactive_blast` require `blast.wav` in the soundfont directory in addition to the `blst.wav` files, as well as the `EFFECT_INTERACTIVE_BLAST` define in your config. You can find more information about Interactive Blast [here.](https://www.fett263.com/proffieOS7-intro.html#blast)

All the blade styles were created in Fett263's [Style Library configurator](https://www.fett263.com/fett263-proffieOS7-style-library.html) and all copyright information is preserved in the comments of the blade style. They were designed for ProffieOS 7.15, and may not work on older versions.
